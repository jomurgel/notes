# Favorites
Favorite things in no particular order of importance.

## Food
Pizza, a good club sandwich or any gas station hot dog.

## Band
My music tastes ebb and flow far too much for me to be able to pick just one artist. Bands I listen to frequently:
- [Anamanaguchi](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2UwJRAgSOi1zcLkvUNc8XL?si=zItamAYaSm-1U0CMJxbPjA)
- [Angels & Airwaves](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7xklw3WodFZiNNmQt3DIgp?si=fXNg6t54TfunTXfMEkmGzQ)
- [Dodie](https://open.spotify.com/artist/21TinSsF5ytwsfdyz5VSVS?si=wbmncJRdQm2cfgMTcd6BZA)
- [FM-84](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1xvEo98zythSrgN69GQevk?si=sDSEvOJvRnGXmkOxOvjPlg)
- [Ingrid Michaelson](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2vm8GdHyrJh2O2MfbQFYG0?si=5RWwl2nhQDuaPaRhqjGg_g)

- [Weird All Yankovic](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1bDWGdIC2hardyt55nlQgG?si=Dzw8_-tMQb-G53SymwFCyA)

## Album
[Kintsugi](https://open.spotify.com/album/6BK3muExDOuk0VnyMn9NVw?si=x-fq2btXSO-DxK0xZWIMLg) by Death Cab for Cutie always feels like an album I need when I need a chill vibe. I also really love [Once Upon a Time](shttps://open.spotify.com/album/4OgfrjaQ0GKEbrxGHVoaEo?si=TyHYS_hfQjmqWwqMgKySeA) by Feeling Left Out. I also find [At War](https://open.spotify.com/album/0FIrp25I4U3bE6glOGq9qi?si=W3StxqYuRYu3oaLynDNKBw) by This Love to be kind of cathartic when I need it to be.

## Musical
Wicked.

## Book
I think I'd have to say, as of 2021, Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. I'm excited to read Ready Player Two.

## Movie
Arrival, starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, directed by Denis Villeneuve, and an amazing score by the late Jóhann Jóhannsson.

## Television Show
I don't know that I could pick just one. A few I really love and get excited for are Ted Lasso, Star Trek Discovery and Picard, Killing Eve, Bosch or The Good Place (RIP). I imagine there have been many over the years.

## Podcast
As of this moment [Hey, Riddle Riddle](https://www.heyriddleriddle.com/), because shoot, those people are talented.

## Commedian
[Mike Birbiglia](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7LA4bHpsuQA1bNuxHpqeIT?si=n3OrnmO-T42LJBa5CLrslQ).

## Photographer
[Ruth Bernhard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bernhard), no contest. Close seconds would be [J. Isobel Delisle](https://www.instagram.com/jisobeldelisle/?hl=en) or [Jingna Zhang](https://www.zhangjingna.com/) right now.
