# Favorites
Favorite things in no particular order of importance.

## Music
[Kintsugi](https://open.spotify.com/album/6BK3muExDOuk0VnyMn9NVw?si=x-fq2btXSO-DxK0xZWIMLg) by Death Cab for Cutie always feels like an album I need when I need a chill vibe. My music otherwise ebbs and flows. I'm not particularly musical myself, so I like music based on how it makes me feel. I like a lot of individual songs, fewer full albums, and even fewer actual bands.

## Book
As of 2021, Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. I'm excited to read Ready Player Two.
