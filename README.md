# Jotes
A collection of personal and professional notes, links, and all the little things I have no want to keep in my memory palace.

## Contact
You can reach me on my website (hopefully updated soon) at [jomurgel.com](https://jomurgel.com) or via email at hello[@]jomurgel.com. The only social network I use anymore is [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jomurgel/) which I still use only occationally.

## [Art & Design](art-design.md)  
I am an artist, designer, and illustrator by school, but also by interest. Contains lists of artists or designers or tools or resources for art, design, illustration, typography, or anything unrelated to photography. Check that out [here](photography.md).

## [Development](development.md)  
By day I'm a Senior User Experience Developer at [Alley](https://alley.co) working primarily with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and the usual frontend developer tools. This contains snippets, packages, resources, and other lists in service of that work.

## [Photography](photography.md)  
Occasionally I'm a photographer. I love photography and some of the moments it can capture. This contains a running list of photographers, inspiration, and resources in services of photography.

## [Favorites](favorites.md)  
For whatever reason I'm always asked what my favorite things are. Now you can read about them so I don't have to remember.

## [Recipes](recipes.md)  
On and off of diet, I like to cook. This will service as my cookbook.

## [Various](various.md)
All the stuff I wasn't sure where to put it. Cleaning notes, gifs... the list is random...
